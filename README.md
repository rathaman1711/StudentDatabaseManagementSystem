# Student-Database-Management-System
This is a sophomore project of Data Base Management System made using Python and Sqlite.
In this student database management system we can add, delete,update,view and clear existing records from the database.
Here Student ID acts as the PRIMARY KEY and we store Student name,age,gender,address and mobile number.
